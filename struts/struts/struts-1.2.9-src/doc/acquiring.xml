    The latest <em>development build</em> of Struts is available 
    <a href="http://svn.apache.org/dist/struts/">here</a>
    in a convenient binary distribution and also with complete source code.

<section name="Nightly Builds" href="Builds">

    <p>
    For developers who are helping to develop Struts, or who just want "the
    latest bits", the latest development version is made available each morning.
    Use at your own risk!
    </p>

    <ul>

    <li>
        Source Repository - Download the source directly via
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">
        anonymous access</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
        Binary builds - Download the binary distribution from one of the
        Struts nightly build directories:
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/builds/struts/nightly/">
        Built by Ant</a> or
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/builds/struts/maven/">
        Built by Maven</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
        Nightly source builds - Download the source distribution from the
       <a href="http://svn.apache.org/builds/struts/nightly/src/">
        Struts nightly sources directory</a>.
    </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        If you are building Struts from source, be sure to refer to the
        <a href="userGuide/installation.html">Installation page</a> in the
        User Guide for prerequisites.
        There are several JARs from the Jakarta Commons project that
        are required to build Struts.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you are interested in the Tag Library Descriptor (TLD) files,
    they are maintained in the
    <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/core/trunk/conf/share/">
    /conf/share</a> folder of the main repository.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also be sure to check the
    <a href="userGuide/release-notes.html">
    Release Notes</a> for the nightly builds so you know what you are getting!
    </p>

    <p>
    Access to the source repository for Struts is available through both
    <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/struts/core/trunk/?root=Apache-SVN">web browser</a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">
